# gwent-tools

A simple tool to help me spend resources in Gwent more efficiently.

## calculate_values.rb

Fill `cards.yml` with the cards you're looking for then run the script. It'll print out the total value of the cards from each set in `set_values.txt` so you know which to pull from.

If you're not playing Gwent, you should play Gwent.
